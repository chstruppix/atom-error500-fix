Hola Amigos!

You're here because Atom, the hackable text editor, is terrible in terms of installation of packages.

All you want to do is install a package in Atom, for ex. Hydrogen, and you've looked for hours but can't seem to find a way to install it, as none of the methods you've tried seem to beworking.

• After some research, you discovered a new method- 'apm install <package>'. However, that does not seem to work for you as well. 
• After headaches and a total mood-buster experience, you tend to think of giving up on coding itself, because you start questioning yourself- 'I can't even set up an IDE, how will I code!'
